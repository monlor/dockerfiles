# http-dump

A simple go web server that dumps the request back to the client using 
go's [httputil.DumpRequest](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#DumpRequest)
function. It also logs the same http request output to stdout.

http-dump was created to help debugging communications between docker services 
within a docker compose.

## Usage

It's highly recommend to use http-dump docker image.

```console
$ docker run --rm -p "8080:8080" -it monlor/http-dump:latest 
```
